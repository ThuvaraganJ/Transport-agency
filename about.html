                        <h3>Our brief history is the brief history of Sri Lanka’s transport sector being disrupted – for the commuter, for the driver, for the better.</h3>

                        <p>It was June of 2014 and Zulfer Jiffry had resigned from his post as CTO at wow.lk, Sri Lanka’s largest e-commerce player, and was itching for his next entrepreneurial journey. Collaborating with friends, Zulfer arrived at a glaring market opportunity: the transport sector in Sri Lanka was obsolete and required urgent disrupting. Technology was available and more technologically-mature markets had demonstrated how the transport-sector could be overhauled to meet the needs of modern citizens.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col history-two">
                        <p>
                            Zulfer and his friends spent a few months developing the prototype that would be ready to be presented to investors. The initial group of three investors were Ajit Gunewardene, Ruchi Gunewardene and Dinesh Rodrigo. Digital Mobility Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., was formed. Immediately more investors expressed interest. Leasing giants LOLC Group resulting in their CIO joining the PickMe Board, while MAS Holdings and Hirdramani Group of Companies also came on board as investors subsequently.
